# The Complete JavaScript Course 2020 - Version 2

This is my work on the [Version 02 of this JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course). The course has had a huge revamp which includes sevon different pathways. I have chosen to focous on Pathway 02, 07 and 05. This is Pathway 02:

### PATHWAY 2: ONLY IMPORTANT PARTS:

Instructions:

1. Youâ€™re in a hurry, and I get that! Here is the
   TLDR version of the course for you.
2. Also, each section contains a roadmap
   where you can find the most important
   lectures of that section.
3. So, to speed up learning even more, you can
   focus only on these important lectures.
4. All this will shrink the course to only 24
   hours! (16h at 1.5x speed )

Sections with comments:

- Developer Skills & Editor Setup: You need to watch at least the first 2 lectures.
