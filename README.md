# The Complete JavaScript Course 2020 - Version 2

This is my work on the [Version 02 of this JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course). The course has had a huge revamp which includes:

- A new section: Developer Skills and Editor Setup
- A new project called Mapty App
- More and better lectures including the How JavaScript Works Behind the Scenes
- Better structure of concepts within Section 9: Data Structures, Modern Operators and Strings
- Better explanations on Section 10: A Closer Look at Functions
- Was not in version 1 - Section 12:  Numbers, Dates, Intl and Timers
- Many new concepts and techniques within Section 13: Advanced DOM and Events
- Better explanations and many additional topics within Section 14: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with JavaScript
- And more...

## New! Roadmap:

Each section contains a roadmap where you can find the most important lectures of that section. I've been using these a lot as they are having handy.

#### PATHWAYS 1-7:

The first Pathway that I will work on is called *Pathway 2: Only Important Parts*. This is because previously I had got upto 80% of the version 1 of this course.

Once I have completed Pathway 2, then I will go straight onto Pathway 7: Only What's New in Version 2. Then the last Pathway I will study is Pathway 5: Only Interested in Frameworks, as I am looking to improve my React.js skills to be able to develop React Apps efficiently.
