<!-- THE STRUCTURE: -->
<!-- Its been a whilst since I've touched HTML5 and CSS as I've been busy on project work and upskilling on JavaScript, Excel VBA, SQL. Therefore this Section 6: HTML and CSS Crash Course
    is a nice refresher for me. -->

<!-- Other things I should put into the title tag is: CSS styles, fav icons (icons that appear in the browser tabs).
Body tag: what will be visible on the web page, i.e. headings, paragraphs, images, links etc -->

<!-- I can write the basic HTML structure in VSCode by type this cmd: ! + tab -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- link HTML file to CSS file -->
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <title>hatever go into the head tag is the settings of the page, i.e. the title using the title tag</title>

</head>
<body>
    <h1> h1 element. This is heading 1, the largest heading</h1>
    <p class="first">To learn DOM manipulation it's useful to have some basic idea of HTML & CSS.</p>
    <h2>Another heading this time heading 2 element.</h2>
    <p class="second">Check out Vanessa's GitHub today:
        <a href="https://github.com/Cyber-Cohort-Projects/ParkingTrackApp/tree/vanessa_dev_branch">Vanessa's GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <h6>This is heading 6, the smallest heading element. Smaller than paragraph inside the paragraph tag. Of course in real life I would use a larger heading, i.e. h3 or h4.</h6>

<!-- MY NOTES:
We now have a basic structure with the DOCTTYPE which identifies this document being HTML 5. Also the language tag that in this case its telling the browser I'm using the English language.
This is why we call the anchor element an inline element - it flows inline with the other text.
The h2 is called a Block element as the heading is NOT inline with the previous text.
The image element also needs an attribute. This link takes the user to my GitHub profile photo. The image element dose not have a closing tag.

There are two important attributes which we can use on all elements, to identify them. These are Classes and id's:
We use Classes and id's to name elements so that we can then select them in CSS in order to style them.
The difference between classes and id's is that id's MUST be unique. Each id can ONLY be used once on a web page, whilst classes can be used multiple times. So I can have more paragraphs
called second, but I can't have another element called: course-image. In practice we actually almost never use id's to style elements or to select them from JS, as its best practice to use
classes.

Now create HTML Form so I can use more attributes. 
Creating boxes. We want the content of this form to be in a box. There are a number of ways of creating boxes in HTML. The most generic box is a div.
Within the input element we use the type attribute to describe this element, use the text attribute, then specify the a placeholder, called it: Your name. This element don't have a closing tag as it don't need it, its self-closing.

Use the button element, add my content. This element has a closing tag as its NOT self-closing.
Now I need some JS code to make this button to work but this is not the point of this HTML/CSS Crash Course.

This is a form as it has an input and button elements. In HTML we have a special element for that - the form element: <form id="your-name">
This is more semantic - meaning the form element better describes the content that is inside the box than just the generic box (has no meaning at all - not good for SEO) that is the div.
So always use semantic HTML.

CSS:
We use CSS to style elements and to create a layout for the overall page.
We can write CSS in the HTML file within the style element. Not for visible content on the page, but go into the head tag.
Each CSS Declaration has a property name, then a value, i.e. we can style the background color.
The: background-color: is the properties. The green is the specified value. The whole line is the including the braces is the declaration block.
In CSS there are some predefined color's.
Its best practice to create a external CSS file to separate the presentation from the content.
