/*** A BRIEF INTRO TO JavaScript ***/

/* 

WHAT IS JS:
JS IS A HIGH-LEVEL, OBJECT-ORIENTED, MULTI-PARADIGM PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:


We don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management;
Instruct computer to do things;
Mostly based on concept of objects for storing most kinds of data;
So flexible and versatile, that we can use all kinds of different programming styles, such as imperative and declarative programming - these different styles are just different ways of structuring our code.


WHAT DO WE USE IT WITH?

HTML, CSS, JS = to create dynamic websites.


We can also use JS for building other web apps using JS Libraries and Frameworks. Makes developing modern, large scale JS apps a lot easier:
React, Angular and Vue.
Tools based on JS. I need to learn to write proper JS before use these frameworks.

JS can also run outside of web browsers. Its possible to use JS on a web server using a popular tech called Node.js, which don't need any browser at all. This allows us to create backend apps which are simply apps that run on a web server and interact with databases. When we use JS in the browsers, we create frontend apps. In this course we use JS for frontend apps. In the future the instructor may add how to use JS outside of the browser environment as well.
We can also use JS to build native mobile apps, as well as native desktop apps for any phones and computer operating system out there due to modern tools like React Native, the Ionic framework and tools like Electron. There is nothing I can't build after being really good at JS.

JS REALSES AND VERSIONS:

ES: ECMA Script.

ES5 > ES6 / ES2015 > ES7/ES2016 > ES8/ES2017 > ES9/ES2018 > ES10/ES2019 > ES11/ES2020.

There was a huge update in 2015 called ES6.  Then a yearly release/versions with couple of new JS  features. In all these versions starting from ES2015, is what we call modern JS.
 
I will learn what is important in ES5.
